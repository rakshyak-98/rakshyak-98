## 🧠 Technological Odyssey

- **💡 Code Explorer**: My journey through technology is driven by a fascination with foundational standards and practices.

- **🖥️ Programming Virtuoso**: My main languages are JavaScript, TypeScript, and Go. I revel in integrating timeless techniques with modern methodologies. Inspired by Linus Torvalds' commitment to transparency and collaboration, I aim to build projects that not only utilize classic tech but also advance it.

- **🌟 Pioneering Influences**: Guided by the wisdom of **Grace Hopper**, a visionary in compiler design, and **Linus Torvalds**, whose Linux kernel revolutionized open-source development. Their monumental contributions remind me of the enduring significance of understanding and leveraging the roots of our technological landscape.
